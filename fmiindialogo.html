        <h3>MARIANIST SISTERS INDIA AND MARIANIST SCHOOL</h3>
        <p>Project Type: Logo <br>
           Client: Marianist Sisters—District of India <br>
           Role: Designer</p><br><br>
        <p>The Marianist Sisters is an international Catholic women’s congregation of consecrated religious Sisters. The Sisters in India needed a logo applicable for their culture. The lotus is a key element in both logos since it is associated with spirituality and religion. The colors and the Marianist cross reflect what the Sisters wear and help the logos be identifiable with the congregation. I was initially asked to help them by designing a logo for their district; however, after presenting a few options to them, they found that one logo worked for the district and another would be great for their school.</p>
