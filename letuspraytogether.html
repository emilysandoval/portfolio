        <h3>LET US PRAY TOGETHER</h3>
        <p>Project Type: Publication Design <br>
           Client: Marianist Mission <br>
           Role: Designer</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE BRIEF</h4>
        <p>The Marianist Mission (a Catholic nonprofit organization focused on a ministry of prayer, religious cards, and fundraising for the Marianists' ministries) asked me to design a prayer booklet for faith sharing groups and for people to use as an aid to prayer. The booklets are in English and Spanish.</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE GOAL</h4>
        <p>The goal was to create a booklet in English and one in Spanish that appealed to the people who speak those languages. One of the elements I used to design for each culture was color. In much of English-speaking culture, prayer means slowing down in a busy, fast-paced life, so the main colors were cool colors. On the other hand, people from Spanish-speaking cultures typically respond more to bright and warm colors. Additionally, in both booklets, I used an illustrative style in order to convey that prayer is approachable and does not have to be too serious. This style also ties both pieces together.</p><br><br>
