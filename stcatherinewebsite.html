        <h3>ST. CATHERINE OF ALEXANDRIA CHURCH: WEBSITE</h3>
        <p>Project Type: Website <br>
           Client: St. Catherine of Alexandria Church (Riverside, CA) <br>
           Role: Designer, Art Director</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE BRIEF</h4>
        <p>St. Catherine of Alexandria Church is a Catholic church in Riverside, California. I was the leader of the Communications Ministry there when the pastor asked us to redesign the parish's website. I led a 3 personÂ team for this project. Under that role, I supervised and made sure that the vision of the site was unified and consistent to the needs of the parish.</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE GOAL</h4>
        <p>The pastor wanted a dynamic website where people can go to it and look up information about the parish and be informed on what is happening there.</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE CHALLENGES</h4>
        <p>There were a couple of challenges. One of which was to create a website that was also mobile-responsive. Another challenge was that the ministry relies on volunteers and possibly staff who are not knowledgeable in coding, so the website must be easy to update.</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>As a result, we designed a website that showed the diversity and community spirit of the parish. We also used the website-making platform Weebly because its drag-and-drop interface made updating the website easy for volunteers and staff who are not familiar with coding.</p>
