        <h3>LIFT TEAM BROCHURE</h3>
        <p>Project Type: Marketing and Advertising Design <br>
           Client: Elevate <br>
           Role: Designer</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE BRIEF</h4>
        <p>Elevate, a Catholic young adult ministryÂ based in Riverside in California, needed a brochure to inform and invite people about joining their leadership team called Lift Team.</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE GOAL AND CHALLENGES</h4>
        <p>The goal for this project was to make a brochure that was appealing to young adults and to help members of the Lift Team talk to Elevate's members about joining their leadership team. The brochures had to be cost-effective and easy to print even from home.</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
