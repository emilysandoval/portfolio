        <h3>PRAYER CARDS</h3>
        <p>Project Type: Print Design and Illustration <br>
           Client: Marianist Mission <br>
           Role: Designer</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE BRIEF</h4>
        <p>This project is a series of prayer cards for the Marianist Mission. It is a nonprofit organization run by the Marianists, a Catholic religious congregation, and focuses on being a prayer and religious card ministry as well as fundraising for the Marianists. These cards were inserted in correspondence to donors as well as given away at Marianist Mission events.</p><br><br>
        <h4>THE GOALS AND CHALLENGES</h4>
        <p>This project had a couple of goals. One of which was to inspire and bring people closer to God. Typically, people give cards to others or keep for themselves to use as tools to help them pray or to bring positivity in their lives. The other goal, which was also a challenge, was to appeal to a wide demographic ranging from Baby Boomers to Millennials and Gen Z. </p><br><br>
        <h4>THE SOLUTIONS</h4>
        <p>I decided to design different prayer cards that appealed to a variety of people. I was very excited for the opportunity to stretch my creativity. I approached this project using photography (some by Marianist Brothers), patterns, and my own illustration.</p>
