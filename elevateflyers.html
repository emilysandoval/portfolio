        <h3>ELEVATE: FLYERS</h3>
        <p>Project Type: Marketing and Advertising Design <br>
           Client: Elevate <br>
           Role: Designer</p><br><br>
        <p>Elevate is a young adult ministry out of St. Catherine of Alexandria and St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Churches in Riverside, California. They form a community where Catholic young adults can share and express their faith and find community with their peers within the Catholic Church. They needed flyers to advertise their meetings which usually had a different topic. Flyers were 4.25 in x 5.5 in to fit on a quarter of a letter-size sheet of paper. The ministry also needed cards with contact information for ministry fairs and information tables. The contact cards were about the same size as business cards. Fitting multiple copies of flyers or contact cards on one sheet of paper made printing them economical for the ministry, and their small size made it easier for people carry with them and/or put in their pocket or purse.</p>
