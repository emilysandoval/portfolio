        <h3>LOGO FOR NACMS</h3>
        <p>Project Type: Logo <br>
           Client: North American Center for Marianist Studies <br>
           Role: Designer</p><br><br>
          <h4>THE BRIEF</h4>
          <p>The North American Center for Marianist Studies, as known as NACMS, is an organization that provides resources for those interested in  the Marianist Family, a Catholic group which includes a men's religious order of Brothers and priests, a women's religious order of Sisters, and lay people.</p><br><br>
          <p>NACMS asked me to design a new logo for them as their current logo that no longer served their needs.</p>
          <h4>Old Logos</h4>
        <div class="work" id="nacms-old-logo">
          <img src="Images/PortfolioImages/NACMS/NACMS-OldLogo1.png" alt="old logo">
          <img src="Images/PortfolioImages/NACMS/NACMS-OldLogo2.png" alt="old logo">
        </div>
        <h4>THE GOAL AND CHALLENGES</h4>
        <p>NACMS's goal is to link the vision of the founders of the Marianists to the contemporary Church and the world through research, publications, and programs. NACMS wanted a logo that is contemporary, modern, and functional to their needs. Therefore, the challenge was to create a timeless logo that they would not need to change later. Additionally, the organization did not have consistency in their brand especially in regards to color. Sometimes, they used blue and sometimes green.</p>
        <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
